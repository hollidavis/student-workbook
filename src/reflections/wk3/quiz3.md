# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern

**1.** What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
```
**2.** How would you access the `name` of the below object using the `property` variable?
```js
let staff = {
  name: "Tim",
  age: 26,
  job: "Code Monkey"
  }
let property = 'name'
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
staff.property
```
**3.** What is Encapsulation?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit. 
```
**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Single Responsibility Principle
```
**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A class is a blueprint which you use to create an instance. So class is the idea of a chair, while an instance is the actual chair.
```
**6.** What is a `Proxy` object?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The Proxy object enables you to create a proxy for another object, which can intercept and redefine fundamental operations for that object.
```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The purpose of the MVC pattern is to separate the concerns or tasks of an application up. This way all the things involved in one task are in one place and sectioned off from another. This also helps with data privacy.
```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 The controller is responsible for controlling the application logic and acts as the coordinator between the service and the model.
```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The service contains the business logic of the application.
```
**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The model contains and populates all the data that is needed by the service.
