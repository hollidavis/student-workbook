**What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?**

+ The Observer Pattern enables developers to update parts of a page in response to certain events, with the data these provide. It helps to synchronize all needed changes when these events happen. 

**What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?**

+ The Subscribe Method: adds new observable events
+ The Unsubscribe Method: removes observable events
+ The Broadcast Method: executes all events with bound data

**Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.**
