**What is the purpose of encapsulation?**

+ Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized access to them.

**What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?**

+ They didn't truly protect the data or made it private. It was still possible to access it, but things like the underscore prefix discouraged people from messing with it. 

**How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?**

+ The use of classes allows us to create private variables, specifically utilizing the scope of classes or functions within classes. For example the variables created in functions within classes are private due to the scope of the function and the fact that the class limits what information leaves the class.
