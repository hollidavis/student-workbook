**What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?**

Code Documentation is some sort of guide or notes on how a piece of code functions or is expected to be used. The three most common types of code documentation are:
+ How to guides for using your code
+ A nice README for the repo
+ Code documentation in the source

**What are some benefits of Code Documentation?**

+ Code documentation helps clear up confusion between code written by other developers & also helps to provide clarity when you come back to your own code weeks or months later. 

**How important is Code documentation and why?**

+ Code documentation is extremely important because it helps save time, confusion, and frustration when using code. By documenting your code you're helping your future self and fellow developers to be able to succeed and not have to waste time trying to decipher old code.
