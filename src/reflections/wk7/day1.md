**What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?**

+ Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation (one screen, keyboard and mouse among the pair). The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the "driver", the other, also actively involved in the programming task but focusing more on overall direction is the "navigator".

**What are some benefits of Pair Programming?**

+ Increased code quality: "programming out loud" leads to clearer articulation of the complexities and hidden details in coding tasks, reducing the risk of error or going down blind alleys

+ Better diffusion of knowledge among the team, in particular when a developer unfamiliar with a component is pairing with one who knows it much better

+ Better transfer of skills, as junior developers pick up micro-techniques or broader skills from more experienced team members

+ Large reduction in coordination efforts, since there are 2 pairs to coordinate instead of individual developers

+ Improved resiliency of a pair to interruptions, compared to an individual developer: when one member of the pair must attend to an external prompt, the other can remains focused on the task and can assist in regaining focus afterwards

**What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?**

+ Both programmers must be actively engaging with the task throughout a paired session, otherwise no benefit can be expected

+ A simplistic but often raised objection is that pairing "doubles costs"; that is a misconception based on equating programming with typing -- however, one should be aware that this is the worst-case outcome of poorly applied pairing

+ At least the driver, and possibly both programmers, are expected to keep up a running commentary; pair programming is also "programming out loud" -- if the driver is silent, the navigator should intervene

+ Pair programming cannot be fruitfully forced upon people, especially if relationship issues, including the most mundane (such as personal hygiene), are getting in the way; solve these first!
