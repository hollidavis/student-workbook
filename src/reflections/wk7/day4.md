# Day 4 | Partner Checkpoint Cont.

## Daily Journal:

**Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?**

+ From this weeks reading I really focused on implementing good partner coding strategies and focused on creating a good user experience when designing the partner checkpoint. 

**What went well?**

+ I felt like the client side of the application went well and even though we struggled with the backend we were able to learn a lot.

**What would you do differently?**

+ If I was to do this again I would spend more time planning the backend. We struggled with the back end the most and had to go back often to adjust things as we discovered things we missed on the first iteration. We also needed to tighten down our server security because we only required authentication from the client side.
