## Daily Journal:

**What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?**

+ Enums are strongly typed constants. They are essentially unique types that allow you to assign symbolic names to integral values.

**How can you modify an Enum?**

+ You can change the base value type of the enum by setting it to a different value.

**How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)**

+ I have not yet used Enums for any of my afternoon projects, but it would be simple to use for a library of different items.
