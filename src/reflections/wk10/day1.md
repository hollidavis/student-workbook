## Daily Journal:

**What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?**

+ Value type - A data type is a value type if it holds a data value within its own memory space. It means the variables of these data types directly contain values.
+ Reference type - A reference type doesn't store its value directly. Instead, it stores the address where the value is being stored.
+ Pointer type - Pointer types do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object.

**What are the Value-type data types?**

+ bool
+ byte
+ char
+ decimal
+ double
+ enum
+ float
+ int
+ long
+ sbyte
+ short
+ struct
+ uint
+ ulong
+ ushort

**In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?**

+ The system selects a random location in memory for the variable. Whereas for value types the system stores the value in the memory space allocated for the variable.
