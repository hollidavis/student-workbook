**What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style?**

+ The two main ways to print to the console are to use console.log and console.error. Console.log is helpful to print a phrase to a console so you can see what certain values are or see when something is occurring. Console.error is coded to only run when an error occurs. 

**Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?**

+ The sources tab allows you to examine the code in a document. This is useful for debugging because you're able to use break points right in the console to find and solve errors. 

**Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?**

+ A better way to debug is to add debuggers directly in your code to pause the code from running at specific points.
