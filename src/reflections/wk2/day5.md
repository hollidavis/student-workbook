# Day 5 | End of Week 2

## Checkpoint
+ [Lofi Clicker Game](https://github.com/hollidavis/lofi-clicker-game)

## Weekly Reflection:
+ This week I struggled with the JavaScript challenges on Tuesday and Wednesday. But later in the week I went back and continued to work on them and that helped me to be able to see my progress. The checkpoint for this week was a cookie clicker style game. The only part of the project I struggled with was the interval to make the "auto click" feature of the game function. When it came down too it I struggled because I was over complicating the issue in my mind. I was trying to write perfect code rather than writing something that worked then improving it from there.
