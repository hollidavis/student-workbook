**What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?**

+ Making a plan before you write your code is essential. Pre-planning allows you to avoid mistakes that you would make if you just started coding without a plan. It gives you a road map for the project and helps to get you get to your desired destination. Mapping a project out also helps to ensure you lay a good foundation of code which is so helpful, especially as a project grows.

**How do you find answers when you are stuck?**

+ When I get stuck I typically start by talking a moment, reviewing the code and seeing if that helps. After I'll typically google and research until I find the answer. If google doesn't have the answers I need I will process the problem out loud, either by myself or with another developer.

**From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?**

+ My biggest takeaways from the article are the plan ahead of time, test often, and don't try to reinvent the wheel. One of the quotes that stuck out to me was:

      "Do not think about programming as writing lines of code. Programming is a logic-based creativity that needs nurturing."
