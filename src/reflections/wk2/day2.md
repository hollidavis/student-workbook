**What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?**

+ The three ways to syntactically write a function are: function declaration (which defines a named function), function expressions (which define a named or anonymous function), and arrow function expression (which is just a shorter way to write function expressions).

**What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?**

+ The difference between a parameter and an argument is that parameters are what you tell the function to expect to receive while arguments are the actual values it receives when run.

**What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?**

+ Higher order functions are when a function accepts another function as a parameter or returns a function at the end. Two examples of higher functions given in the reading are array.prototype.map and array.prototype.filter.
