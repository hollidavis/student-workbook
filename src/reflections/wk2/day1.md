**What is Scope?**

+ Scope is the area that a variable is able to use.

**What is Hoisting?**

+ Hoisting moves variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before code execution.

**In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?**

+ Var declares a variable with global scope
+ Let declares a variable with a local scope
+ Const declares a variable with a local scope, however it's value cannot be changed after declaration.
