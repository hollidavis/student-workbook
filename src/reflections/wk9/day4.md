**What is an SSL certificate?**

+ The technology that powers that little "s" on the https:// is called SSL, which stands for "Secure Sockets Layer."

**What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?**

+ Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificate - This certificate shows the padlock, HTTPS, business name, and business country in the address bar to diminish being mistaken for a spam website.

+ Organization Validated (OV SSL) Certificate - Organization Validated (OV) SSL certificates offer a medium level of encryption and are obtained in two steps. First, the CA would verify who owns the domain and if the organization is operating legally.

+ Domain Validation (DV) Certificate - The Domain Validation (DV) certificate offers a low level of encryption shown as a green padlock next to the URL in the address bar.

+ Wildcard SSL Certificates - Wildcard SSL Certificates are in the "domain and subdomain number" category. Wildcard SSLs ensure that if you buy a certificate for one domain, you can use that same certificate for subdomains.

+ Unified Communications (UCC) SSL Certificate - Also known as Multi-domain SSL certificates, Unified Communications certificates (UCCs) allow multiple domain names to be on the same certificate.

+ Single Domain SSL Certificate = A Single Domain SSL protects one domain.


**What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?**
