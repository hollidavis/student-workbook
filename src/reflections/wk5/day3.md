**In simple terms what is a sub-document?**

+ Subdocuments are documents that are nested in other documents

**When might you use a sub-document?**

+ In mongoose, you'd use one when you need to nest a schema in a schema.

**How do you add to a collection of sub-documents? What about editing them?**

There are two ways to create documents that contain subdocuments:

+ Pass a nested object into new Model
+ Add properties into the created document
