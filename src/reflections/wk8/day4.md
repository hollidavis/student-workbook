**What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?**

+ Unit Testing
+ Component Testing
+ End-To-End (E2E) Testing

**What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?**

+ I think end-to-end testing is the most useful since it helps to test one of the most important parts of a project: the user's experience.

**What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?**

+ I think unit testing is the least useful. Component testing seems more helpful because you're able to test whole components and how they work together rather than just a few lines of code at a time
