**What function does a developer Portfolio provide?**

+ Increased visibility and authority.
+ A way to prove you know your craft.
+ A background of work allowing you to get that first position in the industry.
+ It can show your expertise on a subject.
+ Increasing your personal brand.
+ Stand out from a crowd of candidates in interviews.

**What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?**

+ Having projects that really shine and showcase your best code.

**What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?**

+ For my portfolio I want to use & improve Network, Sprintr, BugLog, and Tally (our capstone project). I also plan on including a couple side projects I have ideas for and want to work on after graduation.
