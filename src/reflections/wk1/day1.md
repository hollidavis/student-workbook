# Day 1 | Intro to Codeworks

## Afternoon:
Today was the first day of the program. As a class we focused on reviewing the course overview, policies, and procedures. Additionally, we set up our journals for the course in GitHub.

## Daily Journal:

**In your own words, why do we use Git?**

+ We use Git because often there are multiple developers working on a project together. Git prevents any conflicts between each developers code & code versions. Git is also a version control system so it allows developers to revert back to previous versions of a project if needed. 

**What are the benefits of having multiple branches?**

+ Multiple branches allow for multiple parallel developments. By having multiple branches we are able to test new code we can then later merge into the master branch if we decide to keep it as part of the master code.

**What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

+ Git is a code repository that is local to your computer. GitHub, however is a remote repository where you can store code and make it accessible to other developers.
