**What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?**

+ One of the favorite tips is to color and weight to create hierarchy rather than size only. I love how this tip helps to give your design a cleaner and more professional look while being relatively simple to utilize. 

**Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.**

The Material Design website is a great space to come and learn about different design concepts, tips, and to find examples of good design.

Coolors also has a helpful section where you can explore trending palettes to get inspiration for your next design theme.

**How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?**

+ Good design effects a users first impression of a website, it guides their eye across the page, it conveys a certain tone or mood for the site as a whole. Without a good design to capture a users attention and provide a pleasant user experience it is easy for a website to be off-putting.
