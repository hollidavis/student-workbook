**What is the purpose of wire-framing?**

+ The purpose of wire-framing is to break down the skeletal outline of a website. It helps to give the developer a clear overview of the site and can provide a starting point or direction when beginning "construction". It's an easy way to convey a product concept to a team and also helps to define specific features needed for the site. 

**What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?**

+ There are three main tiers of wireframes that are created: low-fidelity, mid-fidelity, and high-fidelity. Low-fidelity wire-frames are a great starting point for a webpage and serve as a very basic visual representation. They typically contain the major elements of the page and some details but are a essentially a "rough draft". When bumping up to a mid-fidelity wireframe the level of detail and precision increases. They help to move the desing closer to what the final project will look like. Place holder images & text are still used at this level but added detail such as text weight and shading of elements may be added. Finally, there are high-fidelity wire-frames. These are highly detailed and are often pixel-specific layouts. At this stage real images, fonts, and colors are added rather than placeholders. This is the final mock-up that will be utilized to build the site. 

**Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?**

+ I do think that wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort. They help to ensure the entire team working on a project is one the same page and allows for design choices to be solidified before the coding begins to save time, energy, and effort in the coding stage.
