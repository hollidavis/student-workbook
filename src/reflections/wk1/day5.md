## Checkpoint

## Weekly Reflection:
+ I've really been enjoying the course so far. It is still difficult & challenging but I am enjoying my struggles. This week the class focused on HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. During the week I struggled with figuring out how to add spacing with padding and margin without breaking the rules of containers, rows, and columns. But after completing the checkpoint I feel like I was able to really come to understand this weeks concepts and apply them. The checkpoint really helped to solidify my understanding of what we were taught this week.
