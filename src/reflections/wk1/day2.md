**What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?**

+ A Pseudo-Class is a selector that selects elements under certain conditons. For example, a common one I think I will use often is :first-child. :First-child selects the first element amongst a group of sibling elements. There are several other Psuedo-Classes similar to this such as :only-child, :last-child, etc.

**What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?**

+ Specifity is used to dictate which CSS rule should be applied to a section of code if multiple rules are applicable.

**What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?**

+ !Important overrides any other rules in your code. This can become a problem if over utilized because you maybe have multiple rules with the important tag that could conflict. This also overrides any CSS or Bootstrap styling. Generally, it is best practice not to utilize the !important feature.
