# Foundations of Web Development

**1.** In the terminal, what is the command `cd` used for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
cd stands for "change directory" and is used to navigate from place to place in the terminal. 
```

**2.** In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
mkdir stans for "make directory" and is used to do precisely that. It allows you to make a folder/directory to hold your project files.
```

**3.** What is the `\<html>\</html>` tag in a document?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The \<html>\</html> tag represents the root of an HTML document. It is the top level element and all other elements are descendants of it. 
```

**4.** What does `HTML` stand for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Hypertext Markup Language
```

**5.** What Does `CSS` stand for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Cascading Style Sheets
```

**6.** What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:
```css
 h1.main-title {
   color : rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
 }
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
1. Selector (example: h1.main-title)
    Selectors are used to target specific elements on the DOM
2. Property (example: color)
    Properties are used to specify how to modify the targeted element
3. Value (example: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75))
    Values are used to specify exactly how to modify the presentation. So in our  
    example the property says we are changing the color of the selected element 
    and the value specifies which color we are changing it to. 
```

**7.** What property would you change if you wanted to make a font **Bold**?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
font-weight
```

**8.** In what tag does the majority of your code belong?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

<body>
```

**9.** What three tags can be used to make lists (not list items)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
<ul>
<ol>
<dl>
```

**10.** Define the display `:flex property:`
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
By default an element had a display type of block. This tells the element to take up the full width of its line. By changing the display type to flex we are able to display inline which allows us to alter the size and spacing between elements.
```

**11.** What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
