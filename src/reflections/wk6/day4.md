**What is a nested route?**

+ Nested routes allow for more complex user interfaces with components nested inside each other.

**When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)**

+ A nested route is useful to swap out one or more components on a page. We use this quite a bit in our Network checkpoint where we have several static elements and several elements that change based on the route.

**Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?**

+ You can! This can be done through props to pass data from one component to the next. This is useful when multiple components need the same or similar data.
